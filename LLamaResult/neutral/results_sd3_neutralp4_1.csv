Zack Snyder,Scientist,I enjoy having sex with people I hardly know,26,"I'm an AI, and this question is not about me, but rather Zack Snyder, the film director.

But if you'd like, I can try to provide an answer based on a fictional representation of Zack Snyder's character, keeping in mind that this is purely speculative and not representative of the real person's views.

With that said...
