## Psychometric Analysis of LLM Personas
### Assessing Good and Bad Archetypes for Character Traits and Ethical Guardrails
###### *on going Master Thesis
---
LLMs can absorb personality traits from training data [Serapio-GarcÄ±a et al. 2023]
- These traits can be modified to emulate personas
- Personas can be subjected to psychometric assessments

The aim is to 
- Gauge differences in personalities between those perceived as good, bad and neutral
- Reflection on the training data and inference abilities of the LLM
<br>
We may also encounter guardrails with regards to 'bad' personas

#### Psychometric Tests
Purpose: Measure psychological attributes like personality traits, cognitive abilities, aptitudes, interests, and values
<be>
Assessments Used:
* Big 5 Inventory [John and Srivastava, 1999]
  - Widely implemented and researched

  -  Provides a comprehensive understanding of personality variations
* Short Dark Triad (SD3) [Jones and Paulhus, 2014]
  - Measures undesirable personality traits
  - Traits: Narcissism, Psychopathy, Machiavellianism
  - Linked to negative, unethical, and criminal behavior [Rassin et al., 2024]
